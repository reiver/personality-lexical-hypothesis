# Personality: The Lexical Hypothesis
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

> personality (noun): a person's or animal's nature, especially as it permanently affects their behavior.

## Preamble

Every individual human seems to be their own _special snowflake_.

However, the way that humans behaviorally differ from one another seems to follow a pattern.
I.e., there seems to be a structure to, and limitations on, the ways in which one human can behaviorally differ from another human.

One attempt to understand this pattern, and structure is called the **Lexical Hypothesis**.
