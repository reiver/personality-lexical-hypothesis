# Personality: The Lexical Hypothesis
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

> personality (noun): a person's or animal's nature, especially as it permanently affects their behavior.

## Preamble

Every individual human seems to be their own _special snowflake_.

However, the way that humans behaviorally differ from one another seems to follow a pattern.
I.e., there seems to be a structure to, and limitations on, the ways in which one human can behaviorally differ from another human.

One attempt to understand this pattern, and structure is called the **Lexical Hypothesis**.

## Examples

In many situations, examples help.

Let's give some examples of ways in which ones person might describe the personality of another person:â€¦.

> Joe is usually pretty talkative.

> Jane tends to find fault with others.

> Bella usually does a thorough job.

> Charlie is usually original, and often comes up with new ideas.

> Tina is sometimes shy, and inhibited.

> Fred tends to be lazy.

> Robert is very hardworking.

Each of these examples seems to describe a _long term pattern_ to each of these individuals' behavior.
