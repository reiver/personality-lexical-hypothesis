# Personality: The Lexical Hypothesis
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

> personality (noun): a person's or animal's nature, especially as it permanently affects their behavior.

## Preamble

Every individual human seems to be their own _special snowflake_.

However, the way that humans behaviorally differ from one another seems to follow a pattern.
I.e., there seems to be a structure to, and limitations on, the ways in which one human can behaviorally differ from another human.

One attempt to understand this pattern, and structure is called the **Lexical Hypothesis**.

## Examples

In many situations, examples help.

Let's give some examples of ways in which ones person might describe the personality of another person:….

> Joe is usually pretty talkative.

> Jane tends to find fault with others.

> Bella usually does a thorough job.

> Charlie is usually original, and often comes up with new ideas.

> Tina is sometimes shy, and inhibited.

> Fred tends to be lazy.

> Robert is very hardworking.

Each of these examples seems to describe a _long term pattern_ to each of these individuals' behavior.

## Lexical Hypothesis

One attempt to understand the structure of human personality is what is called the **Lexical Hypothesis**.

The **Lexical Hypothesis** is also called
the **Fundamental Lexical Hypothesis**,
the **Lexical Approach**, and
the **Sedimentation Hypothesis**.

The **Lexical Hypothesis** tries to understand _human personality_ by looking at _human language_.
And usually just one _human language_.

It could be a language such as:
* the Cantonese language,
* the Coptic language,
* the English language,
* the Hausa language,
* the Korean language,
* the Nahuatl language,
* the Nama language,
* the Persian language,
* etc.

Really, it could be any human language.

But the most common way of pursuing the **Lexical Hypothesis** is to pick one _human language_, a perform the analysis on it.

(For example, one might pick the _English language_.
And then perform the analysis using samples of written _English language_)

Once a language is picked, we then make 2 assumption:….

**Assumption №1** is that, any important aspects of _human personality_ will eventually get encoded into a human language.

**Assumption №2** is that, these important aspects of _human personality_ will get encoded as a single word.

The **Lexical Hypothesis** is only good to the degree that these assumptions are true.
And these are people who criticize these assumptions.

Nevertheless this approach — the **Lexical Hypothesis** — is an interesting way of trying to understand _human personality_.
And work based on this does have some degree of utility.

## Examples Under Lexical Hypothesis

Let's look at our previous examples to see how the **Lexical Hypothesis** applies to them.
Doing so will hopefully give us better understanding of what this **Lexical Hypothesis** and its _assumptions_ really mean, in a concrete sense.

> Joe is usually pretty talkative.

In this example, the word “talkative” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

> Jane tends to find fault with others.

In this example, the phrase “find fault” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

**Note that an analysis under the _Lexical Hypothesis_ would miss this phrase, since it is two words, instead of just one.**

> Bella usually does a thorough job.

In this example, the word “thorough” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

> Charlie is usually original, and often comes up with new ideas.

In this example, the word “original” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

Also, in this example, the phrase “comes up with new ideas” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

**Note that here too an analysis under the _Lexical Hypothesis_ would miss this phrase, since it is five words, instead of just one.**

> Tina is sometimes shy, and inhibited.

In this example, the word “shy” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

Also, in this example, the word “inhibited” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

> Fred tends to be lazy.

In this example, the word “lazy” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

> Robert is very hardworking.

In this example, the word “hardworking” encodes an aspect of _human personality_.

Although, one could also argue that in this example, it is the phrase “very hardworking” that is doing the encoding.

Which, although the word “hardworking” would be detected by an analysis under the _Lexical Hypothesis_,
**the phrase “very hardworking” would be missed by an analysis under the _Lexical Hypothesis_.**
