# Personality: The Lexical Hypothesis
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

> personality (noun): a person's or animal's nature, especially as it permanently affects their behavior.

## Preamble

Every individual human seems to be their own _special snowflake_.

However, the way that humans behaviorally differ from one another seems to follow a pattern.
I.e., there seems to be a structure to, and limitations on, the ways in which one human can behaviorally differ from another human.

One attempt to understand this pattern, and structure is called the **Lexical Hypothesis**.

## Examples

In many situations, examples help.

Let's give some examples of ways in which ones person might describe the personality of another person:….

> Joe is usually pretty talkative.

> Jane tends to find fault with others.

> Bella usually does a thorough job.

> Charlie is usually original, and often comes up with new ideas.

> Tina is sometimes shy, and inhibited.

> Fred tends to be lazy.

> Robert is very hardworking.

Each of these examples seems to describe a _long term pattern_ to each of these individuals' behavior.

## Lexical Hypothesis

One attempt to understand the structure of human personality is what is called the **Lexical Hypothesis**.

The **Lexical Hypothesis** is also called
the **Fundamental Lexical Hypothesis**,
the **Lexical Approach**, and
the **Sedimentation Hypothesis**.

The **Lexical Hypothesis** tries to understand _human personality_ by looking at _human language_.
And usually just one _human language_.

It could be a language such as:
* the Cantonese language,
* the Coptic language,
* the English language,
* the Hausa language,
* the Korean language,
* the Nahuatl language,
* the Nama language,
* the Persian language,
* etc.

Really, it could be any human language.

But the most common way of pursuing the **Lexical Hypothesis** is to pick one _human language_, a perform the analysis on it.

(For example, one might pick the _English language_.
And then perform the analysis using samples of written _English language_)

Once a language is picked, we then make 2 assumption:….

**Assumption №1** is that, any important aspects of _human personality_ will eventually get encoded into a human language.

**Assumption №2** is that, these important aspects of _human personality_ will get encoded as a single word.

The **Lexical Hypothesis** is only good to the degree that these assumptions are true.
And these are people who criticize these assumptions.

Nevertheless this approach — the **Lexical Hypothesis** — is an interesting way of trying to understand _human personality_.
And work based on this does have some degree of utility.
